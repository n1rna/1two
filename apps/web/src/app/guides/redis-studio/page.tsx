        <Guide.H2>Redis in the browser</Guide.H2>
        <Guide.P>
          Redis is the go-to in-memory data store for caching, sessions, rate
          limiting, and real-time features. But managing it usually means SSH
          into a server, installing <Guide.Code>redis-cli</Guide.Code>, or
          running a desktop client. The 1tt.dev Redis Studio gives you a
          full-featured Redis browser that runs entirely in the browser - no
          install, no CLI, no SSH.
        </Guide.P>
        <Guide.P>
          The studio uses a tabbed interface so you can have multiple query
          tabs, metrics, monitoring, and framework views open at the same time.
        </Guide.P>
        <Guide.Callout>
          Redis databases are available on{" "}
          <Guide.Strong>Pro</Guide.Strong> and <Guide.Strong>Max</Guide.Strong>{" "}
          plans. Pro gets 1 database, Max gets up to 3.
        </Guide.Callout>

        <Guide.H2>Creating a database</Guide.H2>
        <Guide.P>
          Go to <Guide.Strong>Databases</Guide.Strong> in your account
          dashboard and click <Guide.Strong>Create Redis</Guide.Strong>. Pick a
          name and choose from 7 AWS regions - the database is provisioned in
          seconds, powered by Upstash.
        </Guide.P>
        <Guide.P>
          Each database gets its own REST endpoint, Redis URL, and
          authentication token. You can use these credentials from the studio
          or from your own applications.
        </Guide.P>

        <Guide.H2>Query tabs</Guide.H2>
        <Guide.P>
          Each query tab is an independent command workspace with its own
          history. Type a Redis command, press Enter, and see the result.
          Open as many tabs as you need.

        <Guide.P>
          The Key Explorer scans your entire keyspace and organizes keys into
          a tree by splitting on <Guide.Code>:</Guide.Code> delimiters. If
          your keys follow patterns like{" "}
          <Guide.Code>user:123:profile</Guide.Code> or{" "}
          <Guide.Code>cache:products:featured</Guide.Code>, the tree groups
          them into browsable namespaces.

        <Guide.H2>BullMQ view</Guide.H2>
        <Guide.P>
          If you use BullMQ for job queues, the BullMQ view auto-discovers
          your queues and shows a dashboard for each one. See job counts by
          state (waiting, active, completed, failed, delayed, paused),
          inspect individual jobs, and retry failed jobs.
        </Guide.P>

        <Guide.H2>Sidekiq view</Guide.H2>
        <Guide.P>
          The Sidekiq view loads queue names from the{" "}
          <Guide.Code>queues</Guide.Code> set and shows processed/failed
          counts, per-queue job lists, and the scheduled, retry, and dead
          sorted sets. Each job payload is parsed and displayed with its
          class, args, and error details.
        </Guide.P>

        <Guide.H2>Celery view</Guide.H2>
        <Guide.P>
          The Celery view discovers queues from{" "}
          <Guide.Code>_kombu.binding.*</Guide.Code> keys and task results
          from <Guide.Code>celery-task-meta-*</Guide.Code> keys. Browse
          pending tasks per queue, see task results with color-coded status
          badges, and inspect Python tracebacks for failed tasks.
        </Guide.P>

        <Guide.H2>Metrics and monitoring</Guide.H2>
        <Guide.P>
          The <Guide.Strong>Metrics</Guide.Strong> tab shows a snapshot of
          your database from the Redis <Guide.Code>INFO</Guide.Code> command:
          total keys, memory usage, clients, uptime, ops/sec, and hit rate,
          plus all INFO sections in expandable detail.
        </Guide.P>
        <Guide.P>
          The <Guide.Strong>Live Monitor</Guide.Strong> tab polls INFO at
          a configurable interval (5/10/30 seconds) and tracks trends over
          time. Watch key counts, memory, and ops/sec change in real time
          with delta indicators.
        </Guide.P>

        <Guide.H2>Using your database outside 1tt.dev</Guide.H2>
        <Guide.P>
          Every database comes with a Redis URL for direct connections and a
          REST endpoint for HTTP access. Click the connection details icon
          in the sidebar to copy them.
        </Guide.P>
        <Guide.Callout>
          <pre className="text-xs font-mono overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre">
{`# Direct Redis connection
redis-cli -u redis://default:PASSWORD@host:6379

# REST API
curl https://your-endpoint.upstash.io/get/mykey \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"`}
          </pre>
        </Guide.Callout>
        <Guide.P>
          Or with the <Guide.Code>@upstash/redis</Guide.Code> SDK:
        </Guide.P>
        <Guide.Callout>
          <pre className="text-xs font-mono overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre">
{`import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis"

const redis = new Redis({
  url: "https://your-endpoint.upstash.io",
  token: "YOUR_TOKEN",
})

await redis.set("key", "value", { ex: 3600 })
const val = await redis.get("key")`}
          </pre>
        </Guide.Callout>
        <Guide.P>
          This works in serverless functions, edge runtimes, and any
          environment that supports HTTP - no Redis driver or TCP connection
          needed.
